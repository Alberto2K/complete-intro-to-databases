# Who is this course for?

This course is for anyone who wants to understand the various sorts of databases that are available to them, how to use a few of them, and when to choose which one.

In order to get the most out of this course, you should be comfortable with a command line prompt and a little bit of programming. If you are not familiar with a command line prompt, [I taught a course on it here][command-line] that if you take that will more than get you ready for this course. If you are not familiar with programming, [I have course on that too][web-dev].

All the programming samples will be in JavaScript but if you code in something else like Python or Ruby these code samples should look familiar enough that you should be fine. The code won't be the focus of the samples, the database interactions will be.
