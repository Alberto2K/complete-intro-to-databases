Before we hop in to working with these various sorts of database I want to make sure we are clear on some common terminology and what the goals are for today, what we are going to cover and what we are not.

## What is a database and other common terms

A database is a place to store data. Another way to think about this is that it is a place to save your application's state so that it can be retrieved later. This allows you to make your servers stateless since your database will be storing all the information. A lot of things can be thought of as a type of database, like an Excel spreadsheet or even just a text file with data in it.

A query is a command you send to a database to get it to do something, whether that's to get information out of the database or to add/update/delete something in the database. It can also aggregate information from a database into some sort of overview.
